# FA Tracts Experiments: Fully Connected Non-Variational Autoencoders

## Purpose
These experiments test standard fully connected autoencoders on FA-only tract data using flattened 
input representations. The goal is to compare fully connected architectures against convolutional 
approaches for brain tract reconstruction and determine whether spatial structure matters for this 
type of data.

## Experimental Setup

### Data Preprocessing
- **FA-Only**: Use only FA tracts
- **Fully Flattened**: Concatenate all tract profiles into single vector input
- **Dense Layers**: Use fully connected layers instead of convolutional layers

### Main Experiments
1. **Architecture Comparison**: Test fully connected vs convolutional autoencoder performance
2. **Latent Dimension Search**: Test different bottleneck sizes for dense autoencoders
3. **Reconstruction Quality**: Compare how well FC vs Conv architectures capture tract patterns

### Training Approach
- **Standard Reconstruction**: Basic autoencoder training without variational components
- **Grid Search**: Systematic testing of layer sizes and dropout values
- **Performance Comparison**: Direct comparison with convolutional results

## Expected Findings

### Architecture Analysis
- **FC vs Conv Performance**: Does spatial structure matter for tract reconstruction?
- **Parameter Efficiency**: How do parameter counts compare between architectures?
- **Training Stability**: Which approach converges more reliably?

### Methodological Insights
- **Spatial Information**: Is convolution necessary for brain tract data?
- **Reconstruction Patterns**: What types of tract features do FC autoencoders capture?

### Outputs
- Performance comparisons showing reconstruction quality (RMSE, RÂ²)
- Training curves comparing FC vs convolutional approaches
- Analysis of which architecture works better for different types of tract data
