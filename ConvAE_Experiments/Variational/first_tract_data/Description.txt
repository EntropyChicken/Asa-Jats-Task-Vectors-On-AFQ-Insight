# First Tract Experiments: Variational Autoencoders on Single Tract Data

## Purpose
These experiments apply variational autoencoders to just the first brain tract from the AFQ dataset.
The goal is to establish baseline performance and validate the VAE approach on a simpler, single-tract dataset 
before scaling to more the more complicated multi tract experiments.

## Experimental Setup

### Data Focus
- **Single Tract**: Extract only the first tract (tract 0) from the 48-tract dataset

### Two Main Experiments
1. **Hyperparameter Search** (`conv_combined_first_tract.ipynb`): Test latent dimensions (2-100) and dropout values (0.0-0.5) 
2. **Staged Training** (`vae_age_site_stages_first_tract.py`): Two-stage approach with VAE + age/site prediction on single tract

### Training Approaches
- **Stage 1**: Train VAE, age predictor, and site predictor separately on first tract data
- **Stage 2**: Combined adversarial training with gradient reversal
- **Grid Search**: Systematic testing of latent dimensions and regularization parameters

### Model Performance  
- **Baseline Validation**: Can VAE effectively learn representations from single tract data?
- **Optimal Architecture**: Which latent dimensions - dropout values work best for single tract reconstruction?
- **Age Prediction**: How well can one tract predict biological age?

### Methodological Insights
- **Architecture Validation**: Does the VAE approach work before scaling up?
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: How do latent dimensions and dropout affect single tract learning?
- **Training Stability**: Are there convergence issues that need addressing before multi-tract experiments?

### Comparative Analysis
- **Single vs Multi-Tract**: How much information is lost by using only one tract?
- **Site Effects**: Can adversarial training remove scanner effects from single tract data?
- **Complexity Trade-off**: Does simplification improve or hurt performance?

## Key Outputs
- Hyperparameter heatmaps showing optimal configurations for single tract data
- Validation that VAE architecture works on simplified brain connectivity data
- Baseline performance metrics for comparison with multi-tract experiments
- Reconstruction quality examples showing original vs reconstructed tract profiles
