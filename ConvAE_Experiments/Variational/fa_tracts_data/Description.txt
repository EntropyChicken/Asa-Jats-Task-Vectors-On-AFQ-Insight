# FA Tracts Experiments: Variational Autoencoders with Flattened Data

## Purpose
These experiments focus specifically on FA tract data using variational autoencoders with flattened input representations.
The goal is to test whether simplifying the data to FA-only measurements while flattening the fa tracts 
into a single vector improves model performance and training stability.

## Experimental Setup

### Data Preprocessing
- **FA-Only**: Use only FA measurements (24 tracts)
- **Flattened Format**: Concatenate all tract profiles into single 2400-dimensional vector
- **Simplified Input**: Single channel input instead of multi-tract structure

### Three Main Experiments
1. **Hyperparameter Search** (`vaeconv_combined_fa_flattened.py`): Test latent dimensions (2-100) and dropout values (0.0-0.5)
2. **Staged Training** (`vae_age_site_stages.py`): Two-stage approach with VAE + age/site prediction
3. **Combined Training** (`vae_age_site_conv_combined_fa_flattened.py`): Joint optimization with different loss weight combinations

### Training Approaches
- **Stage 1**: Train VAE, age predictor, and site predictor separately
- **Stage 2**: Combined adversarial training with gradient reversal
- **Grid Search**: Test multiple combinations of reconstruction, KL, age, and site loss weights

## Expected Findings

### Model Performance
- **Optimal Architecture**: Which latent dimensions and dropout values work best for FA data?
- **Loss Weight Balance**: How should reconstruction, age, and site losses be weighted?
- **Training Stability**: Does flattened input improve convergence compared to structured input?

### Methodological Insights
- **Flattened vs Structured**: Does flattening simplify learning or lose important spatial information?
- **FA-Only Benefits**: Is FA sufficient for age prediction and site removal, or is additional DTI info needed?
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: How sensitive are results to latent dimensions and regularization?

### Data Representation
- **Compression Ability**: Can VAE effectively compress 2400-dimensional flattened FA data?
- **Age Prediction**: How well can flattened FA data predict biological age?
- **Site Harmonization**: Does adversarial training remove scanner effects from FA measurements?

## Key Outputs
- Hyperparameter heatmaps showing optimal latent dimensions and dropout combinations
- Training curves comparing different loss weight configurations
- Performance metrics for age prediction and site classification
- Comparison between staged and joint training approaches on simplified data structure
