# First Tract Experiments: Non-Variational Convolutional Autoencoders

## Purpose
These experiments test standard convolutional autoencoders on just the first brain tract (tract 0) from the 48-tract dataset. The goal is to validate the autoencoder approach on a simplified single-tract problem and find optimal hyperparameters before scaling to multi-tract experiments.

## Experimental Setup

### Data Focus
- **Single Tract**: Extract only the first tract (tract 0) from the full dataset
- **FA + MD Data**: Use both Fractional Anisotropy and Mean Diffusivity measurements
- **Baseline Validation**: Test fundamental autoencoder performance without multi-tract complexity

### Two Main Experiments
1. **Latent Dimension Search** (`conv_latent_dimensions.ipynb`): Test different latent sizes [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100]
2. **Combined Grid Search** (`conv_combined_experiment.ipynb`): Test dropout rates [0.0-0.5] Ã— latent dimensions [10-100]

## Expected Findings

### Architecture Validation
- **Method Validation**: Can autoencoders effectively learn single tract representations?
- **Optimal Latent Size**: Which dimensions work best for single tract reconstruction?
- **Regularization Effects**: How does dropout affect performance on simplified data?

### Outputs
- Performance heatmaps showing RMSE across hyperparameter combinations
- Training curves comparing different latent dimensions
- Baseline metrics for comparison with multi-tract experiments
